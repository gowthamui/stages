# Study Forms
Study forms are forms created specifically for a study, not for a participant. A study form is an ideal option if you want to collect data that is not directly related to a participant. Examples of study forms can be a drug log, a repository for all documentation used in the study, and a central location to document all communication between an IRB approval department or a collaborating department.

By design, a participant will never see a study form.
