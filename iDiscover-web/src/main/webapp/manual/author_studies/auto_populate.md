# Auto Populate

Data can be auto populated from a query written to run against the EDW. Once a query is written it needs to be added by a member of the HWCIR team. The query will pull data any time the user needs.

####How to Add SQL Query to Auto Populate Data
1. Write a SQL query or consult with the EDW team to get a query written and send to the HWCIR team so it can be added to the query library in ResearchDoc.
2. Once in the query library it can be added to a study.
3. To add auto populate functionality to a question, click on “Advanced” tab, and select an EDW query from the list.
4. NOTE: The auto populate functionality will only work on string, multi-line string, and number answer types.
