# Terminology
Adding Terminology to a question will facilitate future re-use of the data being collected based on established standards.  The Terminology feature will most often be used as a research project matures and it appears that it would be worthwhile to create a DataMart within the EDW such that non-ResearchDoc researchers would use the same database.


1. On the terminology tab, select “code set” in the Type field, and enter a value and click “Add Tag” button to add a tag.
    2. LOINC: lab codes
    3. ICD9/ICD10: billing codes
    4. NCID: Internal identifier to Intermountain Healthcare
    5. PTEXT: Help1 codes
    6. SNOMED: national standard clinical terminology http://www.nlm.nih.gov/research/umls/Snomed/snomed_main.html
