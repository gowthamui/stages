# FAQs

#####Do I need Chrome installed on my iPad to use ResearchDoc?
No. Download the ipad app using this URL: https://rsowebtst.co.ihc.com/iDiscover-web/unauth/releases/Deploy.jsp. (This is also found under the admin section of ResearchDoc on the desktop version.) You must have the iPad set up with your IS department, have Airwatch installed, and be connected to the healing4life network to use ResearchDoc on an iPad. Google Chrome is not required for the iPad.
