##Approval

If a user has the "Approver" role, they can receive pending items which allow for review and approval. Once a form is completed for a participant another user may submit the form for approval. This notification will let the approver know they can review that submitted form. If the approval is denied, a pending item will be assigned back to the person who submitted the form for approval. If approved, the reminder will be removed from the pending items list.
